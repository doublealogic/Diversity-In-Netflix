# Diversity in Netflix (Project 2 Group F)

## Background and Project Overview
This repository focuses on a data ecosystem where we combined a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and at least one database, in our case SQL.

Project Tasks: 
* With all of these resources, our task was to tell a story with data visualizations.
* The focus would be on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves.

## Our Proposal
Here were the questions we asked:
* Which country has the most representation on Netflix?

* Which genres have the most representation? Which has the least representation?

* Who is winning the war between platform dominance: movies or TV series?
