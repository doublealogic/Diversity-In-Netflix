# Diversity in Netflix (Project 2 Group F)

## Background and Project Overview
This repository focuses on a data ecosystem where we combined a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and at least one database, in our case SQL.

Project Tasks: 
* With all of these resources, our task was to tell a story with data visualizations.
* The focus would be on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves.
* We all wrote our own proposal for projects, and were then split into groups.
* Once in groups, we received everyone else's proposals and picked one among them to use for this project simulating real life situations where we would get tasks and projects to do for varying clients that may cover subjects outside our fields of interests.

## Our Proposal
The proposal we chose centered around diversity in Netflix shows and movies. In the past decade, there have been two major assumptions about changing trends in entertainment that have emerged.
* The first was that streaming binging has gained increased cultural relevance over the past several years.
* Second, that the most emblematic service of that rise in popularity is Netflix. 

With the above in mind, we wanted to explore what Neflix was offering currently in terms of diversity. Here were the questions we asked when putting this together:

* Which country has the most representation on Netflix?

* Which genres have the most representation? Which has the least representation?

* Who is winning the war between platform dominance: movies or TV series?

## Data Resources
To help parse this information, we used several datasets to help us piece together our analysis:
* Dataset #1 - https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows?select=netflix_titles.csv (You can find its corresponding csv [`here`](NetflixKaggle.csv)
* Dataset #2 - 
* Trakt API - https://trakt.docs.apiary.io/
